        <div class = "info">
        <p class="info5" style="display: none;">The settlement was founded in 1830 as Akmola or Akmolinsky prikaz
        (Russian: Акмолинский приказ "prikaz [office] of Akmoly"). This name was possibly given after a local landmark—Akmola
        literally means "white grave" or "holy city" in Kazakh—although this theory is not universally accepted. In 1832,
        it was granted town status and renamed Akmolinsk.On 10 December 1997, the city replaced Almaty as the capital of Kazakhstan.
        On 6 May 1998, it was renamed to Astana, which means "capital city" in Kazakh. On 20 March 2019, the capital was renamed
        from Astana to its current name Nur-Sultan in honor of the long-ruling Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, shortly
        after his resignation. Nur-Sultan (нұр-сұлтан) can be read literally as "radiant sultan" in the Kazakh language.
        The city also has an alternative name, known as Tselinograd (Russian: Целиноград, lit. 'City of virgin lands').
        The name has been in use since 1961 to mark the city's evolution as a cultural and administrative center of the Virgin Lands campaign.</p>
        <br>
        </div>
        <div class="info">
        <p class="info1" style="display: none;">Nur-Sultan is almost 1,000 km (600 miles) away from the country's largest city and former capital, Almaty.
        The nearest big cities are Karaganda (200 km) and Omsk in Russia (450 km).</p>
        <h3 class="info1"  style="display: none;">Topography</h3>
        <p class="info1" style="display: none;">Nur-Sultan (Astana) is located in central Kazakhstan on the Ishim River in a very flat, semi-arid steppe
        region which covers most of the country's territory. It is at 51° 10' north latitude and 71° 26' east
        longitude. The city encompasses 722.0 square kilometres (278.8 sq mi). The elevation of Nur-Sultan (Astana)
        is 347 metres (1,138 ft) above sea level. Nur-Sultan is in a spacious steppe landscape, in the transitional
        area between the north of Kazakhstan and the extremely thinly settled national centre, because of the
        Ishim River. The older boroughs lie north of the river, whilst the new boroughs are located south of the Ishim.</p>
        <h3 class="info1" style="display: none;">Time</h3>
        <p class="info1" style="display: none;">The time offset from the UTC used by Nur-Sultan is 6 hours after UTC, or UTC+6:00. This is also used by most of
        Kazakhstan and Almaty.</p>
        <h3 class="info1" style="display: none;">Climate</h3>
        <p class="info1" style="display: none;">Nur-Sultan is the second-coldest national capital in the world after Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, a position formerly
        held by Canada's capital, Ottawa, until Nur-Sultan attained capital city status in 1997. Nur-Sultan has an
        extreme continental climate with warm summers (featuring occasional brief rain showers) and long, very cold,
        dry winters. Summer temperatures occasionally reach 35 °C (95 °F) while −30 to −35 °C (−22 to −31 °F) is not
        unusual between mid-December and early March. Typically, the city's river is frozen over between the second
        week of November and the beginning of April. Nur-Sultan has a well-deserved reputation among Kazakhs for its
        frequent high winds, the effects of which are felt particularly strongly on the fast-developing but relatively
        exposed Left Bank area of the city. Overall, Nur-Sultan has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate
        classification Dfb).The average annual temperature in Nur-Sultan is 3.5 °C (38.3 °F). January is the coldest
        month with an average temperature of −14.5 °C (5.9 °F) and record lowest is in January 1893's cold wave
        reaching temperatures down to −51.6 °C (−60.9 °F).</p>

        <h3 class="info2" style="display: none;">Population</h3>
        <p class="info2" style="display: none;">As of January 2020, the population of Nur-Sultan (Astana) is 1,136,008; over double the 2002 population
        of 493,000. As of 2018, ethnic Kazakhs made up 80.6 % of the city population, representing an increase
        from 17% during the country's independence.</p>

        <p class="info2" style="display: none;">Many argue that a drive to attract ethnic Kazakhs northward was the key factor in shifting the capital,
        which was officially put down to lack of space for expansion in the former capital, Almaty, and its
        location in an earthquake zone. Nur-Sultan would also be 'closer to the industrial center of
        Kazakhstan' than Almaty. In 1989, Tselinograd had a population of 281,000. The ethnic mix was about
        17.7% Kazakh, 54.1% Russian and 28.2% other ethnic groups. By 2007, Astana's population had more than
        doubled since becoming the capital, to over 600,000, and it topped 1 million in 2017. Migrant
        workers—legal and illegal—have been attracted from across Kazakhstan and neighbouring states such as
        Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, and Astana is a magnet for young professionals seeking to build a career.
        This has changed the city's demographics, bringing more ethnic Kazakhs to a city that formerly had a
        Slavic majority.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="info">
        <p class="info3" style="display: none;">Nur-Sultan's economy is based on trade, industrial production, transport, communication and
        construction. The city's industrial production is mainly focused on producing building materials,
        foodstuff and mechanical engineering. The Astana International Financial Center (AIFC) opened in July
        2018 to become a hub for financial services in Central Asia. Nur-Sultan is the headquarters of
        state-owned corporations such as Samruk-Kazyna, Kazakhstan Temir Zholy, KazMunayGas, KazTransOil,
        Kazatomprom, KEGOC, Kazpost and Kazakhtelecom. The shift of the capital has given it a powerful boost
        to Nur-Sultan's economic development. The city's high economic growth rate has attracted numerous
        investors. In the 16 years since Nur-Sultan became the capital, the volume of investments has increased
        by almost 30 times, the gross regional product has increased by 90 times, and industrial output has
        increased by 11 times. The city's Gross Regional Product makes up about 8.5 per cent of the republic's
        Gross domestic product. The Nur-Sultan – New City special economic zone was established in 2001 to help
        develop industry and increase the attractiveness of the city to investors. Nur-Sultan's administration
        is promoting the development of small and medium-sized businesses through the cooperation of
        the Sovereign Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna and National Economic Chamber. Support is provided by a
        special programme of crediting. Tourism becomes one of the factors that drive economic growth in the city.
        Nur-Sultan is among the top ten most attractive tourist cities in
        the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).</p>

        <div class = "info">
        <p class="info6" style="display: none;">Nur-Sultan (Astana) is subdivided into four districts. Almaty District was
        created on 6 May 1998 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of 21,054 hectares
        (52,030 acres; 81.29 square miles) with a population of 375,938 people. The district has five villages. Yesil District,
        which is also called left bank of the city, was created on 5 August 2008 by presidential decree. The district's territory
        encompasses an area of 31,179 ha (77,040 acres; 120.38 sq mi) with a population of 119,929 people. Saryarka District was
        created on 6 May 1998 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of 19,202 ha (47,450 acres; 74.14 sq mi)

        encompasses an area of 18,129 ha (44,800 acres; 70.00 sq mi) with a population of 233 351 people. In April 1998, the Government of
        Kazakhstan asked architects and urban planners of international renown to participate in a design competition for the new capital.
        On 6 October 1998, Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa was awarded the First Prize. Kurokawa's proposal aimed to preserve and
        redevelop the existing city, and create a new city at the south and the east sides of the Ishim River, enabling the Symbiosis of
        the History and the Future. North of the railway line, which crosses Nur-Sultan in an east–west direction, are industrial and poorer
        residential areas. Between the railway line and the Ishim river is the city centre, where at present intense building activity is occurring.
        To the west and east are more elevated residential areas with parks and the new area of government administration to the south of the
        Ishim River. Here many large building projects are under way; for example, the construction of a diplomatic quarter, and government buildings.
        By 2030, these quarters are to be completed. Nur-Sultan's chief planner, Vladimir Laptev, wants to build a Berlin in a Eurasian style.
        He has stated that a purely administrative capital such as Canberra is not one of his goals.
